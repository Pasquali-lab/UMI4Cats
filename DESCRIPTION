Description: UMI-4C is a technique that allows characterization of 3D chromatin 
    interactions with a bait of interest, taking advantage of a sonication step to 
    produce unique molecular identifiers (UMIs) that help remove duplication 
    bias, thus allowing a better differential comparsion of chromatin 
    interactions between conditions. This package allows processing of UMI-4C 
    data, starting from FastQ files provided by the sequencing facility. It provides 
    two statistical methods for detecting differential contacts and includes a 
    visualization function to plot integrated information from a UMI-4C assay.
