abstract = {The early stages of type 1 diabetes (T1D) are characterized by local autoimmune inflammation and progressive loss of insulin-producing pancreatic $\beta$ cells. Here we show that exposure to proinflammatory cytokines reveals a marked plasticity of the $\beta$-cell regulatory landscape. We expand the repertoire of human islet regulatory elements by mapping stimulus-responsive enhancers linked to changes in the $\beta$-cell transcriptome, proteome and three-dimensional chromatin structure. Our data indicate that the $\beta$-cell response to cytokines is mediated by the induction of new regulatory regions as well as the activation of primed regulatory elements prebound by islet-specific transcription factors. We find that T1D-associated loci are enriched with newly mapped cis-regulatory regions and identify T1D-associated variants disrupting cytokine-responsive enhancer activity in human $\beta$ cells. Our study illustrates how $\beta$ cells respond to a proinflammatory environment and implicate a role for stimulus response islet enhancers in T1D.},

@article{Schwartzman2016,
abstract = {We developed a targeted chromosome conformation capture (4C) approach that uses unique molecular identifiers (UMIs) to derive high-complexity quantitative chromosome contact profiles with controlled signal-to-noise ratios. UMI-4C detects chromosomal interactions with improved sensitivity and specificity, and it can easily be multiplexed to allow robust comparison of contact distributions between loci and conditions. This approach may open the way to the incorporation of contact distributions into quantitative models of gene regulation.},
